    "**The profile page is a personalized section where users can manage their personal information, including their name, email, date of birth, and city. Here's how it works:**\n",
    "- Adding Information (POST Request): When new users access their profile page, it's initially empty. They can fill in their personal details and submit them. This action sends a POST request to the database, which stores their data and generates a unique user ID.\n",
    "- Loading Information (GET Request): Each time the profile page is reloaded, a GET request is made to retrieve all user data from the database. The system then identifies and displays the current user's information based on their unique ID.\n",
    "- Updating Information (PUT Request): Users can edit any of their details on the profile page. When they save their changes, a PUT request is sent to update their information in the database, with the updated data and user ID included in the request.\n",
    "- Deleting Information (DELETE Request): If users choose to remove their profile information, a DELETE request is sent to the database, specifying their ID to ensure only their data is deleted.\n",

    "**Hereâ€™s an explanation of how the backend handles API requests in sbuserapi.py:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- GET Request (get_sbusers()): This function retrieves all user data from the Python SQLite database. It processes the data and sends it back to the frontend as a JSON response. A status code indicating success (e.g., 200 OK) is returned.\n",
    "- POST Request (add_user()): When a new user adds their information, this function is called. It inserts the provided data into the SQLite database. If successful, it returns a status code (e.g., 201 Created) and a JSON message confirming the addition. If the input is invalid, an error message is sent with an appropriate status code.\n",
    "- PUT Request (update_user(id)): This function is used to modify an existing user's data. It updates the corresponding fields in the database for the specified user ID. On success, it returns a status code (e.g., 200 OK) and a confirmation message. If the user ID or input data is invalid, an error response is sent.\n",
    "- DELETE Request (delete_user(id)): To remove a user's data, this function deletes the record associated with the given user ID from the database. It returns a status code (e.g., 200 OK) and a success message if the operation is completed. If the ID doesn't exist, an error status and message are returned."
