    "Our project received high praise for its well-designed and aesthetically pleasing user interface. Many liked the styling, layout, and interactive features, describing the design as relaxing and well-executed. The inclusion of a calendar, note-sharing functionality, and search capabilities stood out as particularly useful aspects that enhanced the overall user experience. The multiple features and thoughtful design choices made the project seem engaging and practical.\n",

    "- **Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some areas could be improved to enhance usability and functionality. Some suggested making the calendar more fluid for a better experience and adding a way to organize cards for better content management. Others recommended refining the level system and incorporating dropdown menus to better connect different sections of the site. Additionally, feedback suggested that admin privileges should be more structured, ensuring that only admins can delete or moderate posts to maintain content integrity. Minor adjustments to the color scheme and project name were also mentioned as potential areas for refinement.\n",

    "The customizable profile page allows users to **input** and manage personal information, such as name, username, email, password, date of birth, and city, through editable input fields. Users interact with these fields by clicking to edit the data, and upon submitting the changes, the updated information is **stored in a database** using Flask and SQLAlchemy. A database is used to manage the collection of user data, and the program includes a **procedure**, put(), which accepts **parameters** (user ID, name, username, email, password, dob, city), validates the input, updates the database with the new information, **and returns a success or error message** based on the validity of the input. The procedure incorporates **sequencing** (processing inputs), **selection** (checking for missing or invalid data), and **iteration** (iterating over input fields for validation). After the user submits their changes, the updated profile is displayed on the frontend, with **visual output** showing the updated data, and a confirmation message is provided to inform the user that their profile has been successfully updated.\n",

    "### Skill 1.A - Binary Search (0%)\n",
    "- Understand how binary search works: Review how it divides a sorted list in half repeatedly to locate a target value.\n",
    "- Learn the conditions for using binary search: Ensure you recognize that the list must be sorted before applying binary search.\n",
    "- Practice tracing binary search steps: Given a list and a target value, manually go through each step to see how the search narrows down.\n",
    "- Review iterative vs. recursive implementations: Understand both versions and when each might be used.\n",
    "### Skill 3.B - Calling Procedures (80%)\n",
    "- Check parameter passing: Ensure you understand how arguments are passed into functions and how return values are used.\n",
    "- Practice with different procedure types: Work with procedures that return values vs. those that modify global variables.\n",
    "- Understand scope and side effects: Make sure you know whether a procedure modifies variables inside or outside its scope.\n",
    "### Skill 5.D - Safe Computing (67%)\n",
    "- Review cybersecurity principles: Learn about phishing, malware, strong passwords, encryption, and multi-factor authentication.\n",
    "- Understand data privacy concerns: Study how companies collect, store, and protect user data.\n",
    "- Recognize common security threats: Be familiar with SQL injection, DDoS attacks, and social engineering tactics.\n",
    "- Apply security best practices: Know how to create secure passwords, avoid suspicious links, and use HTTPS for secure web browsing.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "I demonstrated strong proficiency across most topics, achieving 100% in areas like program design, conditionals, iteration, algorithms, and cybersecurity concepts. My strengths indicate a solid grasp of foundational computing principles, logical problem-solving, and procedural programming. However, areas for improvement include binary search (0%), where I need to review how it works and when to apply it, and safe computing (67%), where a deeper understanding of cybersecurity threats and best practices could be beneficial. Additionally, improving my calling procedures (80%) knowledge by practicing function calls, return values, and parameter passing could help solidify my understanding.\n",

    "Working on the StudyBuddy project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to capitalize on my strengths in **design and idea generation**. I was able to come up with features like the chatroom and profile page, and planning these elements ahead of time helped me structure the project effectively. However, I faced challenges in ensuring different parts of the website, like the frontend elements and the backend database, **worked seamlessly together**. Debugging also proved difficult, as **identifying and fixing issues was sometimes time-consuming**. Despite these obstacles, I’ve gained a lot of knowledge and confidence in the **development process, user interaction, and feature practicality**. This experience has reinforced my desire to pursue a computer science degree and explore internships at large tech companies to see how these principles apply to real-world scenarios. In the future, I hope to build on what I’ve learned by pursuing deeper studies in **algorithms and data structures**, as well as seeking to gain **hands-on experience in large-scale development** through internships. This will help me better understand how to approach complex projects and contribute to impactful software. I’m also excited about the opportunity to network with professionals, collaborate with peers, and continue refining my skills, all while working on meaningful projects that connect directly to real-world needs.\n",
